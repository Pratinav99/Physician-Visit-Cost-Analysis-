# Physician-Visit-Cost-Analysis-

## Overview
This repository contains the materials and code for the project "Analyzing Medical Procedure Costs ." The aim of this project is to conduct an advanced analysis of medical procedures to optimize healthcare costs predictively in USA. Using various datasets related to providers, healthcare facilities, medical procedures, quality scores, and physician visit costs, we have developed predictive models to identify cost-effective procedures and created interactive dashboards for patients and insurance providers.

## Motivation
Rising healthcare costs necessitate proactive analysis of the cost-effectiveness of medical procedures. By predicting procedure costs, this project aims to help healthcare organizations make informed decisions, improve efficiency, and minimize expenses.

## Key Issues Addressed
Our project tackles key issues in healthcare cost management by enhancing cost transparency, revealing significant geographical and specialty-based disparities, and addressing fragmented data through integration and cleaning. By developing accurate predictive models, we help forecast healthcare costs, aiding in better financial planning for patients and informed decision-making for healthcare providers. These insights also support more efficient resource allocation, ultimately improving the sustainability of the healthcare system.
